# Mature App Starter

Use this skill to establish a strong baseline before building a new app. Keep the output practical:
decisions, tradeoffs, file structure, verification, and next actions.

## First Pass

Start by identifying:

- Target users and their high-stakes moments.
- Core job-to-be-done and first valuable workflow.
- Platform target: web, mobile, Expo, native, desktop, or API-first.
- Domain risk: privacy, safety, compliance, accessibility, payments, identity, user-generated content, regulated data, or sensitive workflows.
- Current stage: idea, prototype, MVP, beta, production, or rebuild.

If the user has not provided enough context, make conservative assumptions and label them.

## Product And UX Baseline

- Build the real primary workflow first, not a landing page.
- Keep information architecture simple: primary nav, main task surface, settings/account, and support/legal when needed.
- Design for repeated use: dense enough to scan, clear states, predictable navigation, and low-friction recovery.
- Include empty, loading, error, offline, permission-denied, and success states early.
- Prefer accessibility by default: semantic controls, readable contrast, scalable text, keyboard/screen-reader paths, and touch targets.
- For sensitive domains: avoid overclaiming, protect user data, clarify escalation paths where relevant, and design for trust and auditability.

## Technology Baseline

- Prefer boring, well-supported technology unless the product need justifies complexity.
- Choose one app architecture and document it early.
- Keep route/screen files thin; put product logic in feature modules.
- Keep external systems behind typed service boundaries.
- Centralize environment config and never scatter secret or environment reads across UI code.
- Use structured domain types close to the feature first; promote to shared types only after reuse is real.
- Add observability, analytics, and error reporting behind wrappers before calls spread.

## Engineering Setup

Recommend a starter structure like:

```text
app-or-routes/
src/
  features/
  components/
  services/
  lib/
  config/
  types/
  test/
docs/
  adr/
  project-index.md
  engineering-workflow.md
```

Create or recommend:

- Root `AGENTS.md` for project-wide rules.
- Domain `AGENTS.md` files for `src/features/`, `src/services/`, and backend/schema folders when they exist.
- ADRs for stack choice, backend strategy, testing strategy, analytics/observability, and sensitive-data handling.
- A focused task workflow skill only when the project has a repeated task process.

## Verification Baseline

- Typecheck and lint from the start.
- Unit-test domain logic, calculations, parsing, permissions, and state transitions.
- Component-test critical UI states where practical.
- Add end-to-end smoke tests after the first stable workflow exists.
- Manual UX checks are required for responsive layout, accessibility, and mobile ergonomics.

## Security And Data Baseline

- Classify data by sensitivity before modeling storage.
- Keep secrets server-side and out of app bundles.
- Add auth only when the product workflow needs identity; when added, design roles and recovery paths deliberately.
- For sensitive or regulated domains, treat privacy, audit trails, consent, retention, and export/deletion as first-class requirements.
- Avoid collecting data that is not needed for the first useful workflow.

## Blueprint Reference

For deeper guidance, read `references/index.md` first and then load only the specific referenced
file needed for the user's request.

## Output Shape

For a new app plan, return:

1. Recommended product scope.
2. Suggested architecture and stack.
3. Starter folder structure.
4. UX principles and key states.
5. Security/privacy assumptions.
6. Testing and verification plan.
7. Suggested `AGENTS.md` layers.
8. Next 3 to 5 implementation tasks.

If implementation begins, keep changes small and create the foundation before feature breadth.
